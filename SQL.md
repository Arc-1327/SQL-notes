## Structured Query Language
* Developed by IBM during the 1970s.
* SQL is a standard language to interact with and manage databases.
* Key functions of SQL:
  - Query, ADD, DELETE, MODIFY
* Data scientists, ML engineers, Software engineers, etc use SQL.
* SQL is a domain-specific and declarative language, not a general-purpose programming language.
* Steps for execution of an SQL statement:
  - SQL statement - query is submitted to the database
  - Parser - understands the query and checks the syntax and semantics of the query
  - Compiler - finds the most effective way to optimize the query and generates code based on it
  - Query Executor - executes the query to fetch or modify the required data
  - Database - performs necessary operations
  - Results - results are sent back to the user
